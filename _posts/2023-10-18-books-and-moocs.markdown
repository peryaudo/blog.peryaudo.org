I've finished a bunch of online courses (MOOCs) and books in the last 1+ year. Here's my brief review of them.

## Online courses

### Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree (Udacity)

I became interested in self driving cars in late 2021 and started this course in early 2022. This course was an introductory course meant to be taken before the Self Driving Car Engineer nanodegree, but looking back, I wouldn't recommend this for someone who already has prior experience in programming. For me, it was too easy and also not many contents are directly related to self driving cars.

### Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree (Udacity)

In general it was a great course, giving me the overview of major components in self driving cars, and also providing pointers on what I should learn next. After finishing this course, I read Probabilistic Robotics, and it helped me understand the book a lot.

Cons:

* Often times assignments were broken. Some of them were probably due to TensorFlow upgrade in the VM environment. Also you were supposed to work on assignments in a remote VM, which was a bit painful for me.
* I felt some contents were already a bit outdated.

### Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera/DeepLearning.ai)

This is the best course I've taken so far, along with Practical Deep Learning with Coders. Assignments were high quality.

### Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 1 & 2

## Books

* Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology
* Probabilistic Robotics
* Learn OpenGL (gave up in the middle)
* Autonomous Driving (Ninomiya et al.)
